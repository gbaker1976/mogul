							"about": "It's him. It's always been him. He must be yours, forever. And with a single drop of Lovespell, he will be. He simply can't resist. He's drawn to you, mind, body and soul. Sandalwood, Vanilla and Frankincense give this light perfume a sensually sweet base. Middle notes of Jasmine, Rose Hip and Clove lend a seductive, floral freshness fit for lovers. Finished off with a top note of Grapefruit, this fragrance is well balanced and feminine.",
							"ingredients": "Sandalwood, Vanilla, Frankincense, Jasmine, Rose Hip, Clove, Grapefruit, Apricot Kernel Oil",
							"howToUse": "Perfumes crafted from natural essential oils differ greatly from perfumes found in a department store that are made using headache-inducing chemicals. All natural perfumes stay close to the skin and are meant to be enjoyed by you and those you're closest to. These scents will not be smelled from far away. They are intimate and sensual and evolve over the course of a few hours before fading. Reapply as desired. Dab onto your pulse points: the wrists and neck. Gently pat wrists together and enjoy. Please note that everyone's body chemistry is different. Because of this, not all perfumes will work with your body. You may love the scent in the bottle and on someone else, but dislike it on yourself, and that is perfectly normal. Keep sampling the perfumes until you find the one that works best with your body chemistry. Store perfumes in a cool, dark place to ensure long lasting results.",

					"content": "<header><h2>About Me</h2></header><p>Well hello there! Welcome to my site! Are you curious about the person behind Sweet October? If you are, you've come to the right place! Here are a few tidbits about my life in Indiana, where there is an abundance of farmland, tornadoes and corn.</p><p>I'm a homemaker and wearer of many hats. I have a 5 year old daughter and am married to my best friend of 6 years. Our home is constantly filled with creativity in all forms! Aside from my perfume making, I sew anything that strikes my fancy. I love to cook and bake, especially with my husband. I love photography and probably take more pictures of my daily life than any one person should, but can you really have too many photos of your memories? My thoughts exactly. I'm absolutely obsessed with interior design and anything house related, and am in love with anything from the atomic era! Hello, Mid Century Modern furniture! Going antiquing is one of my all time favorite things to do. I love to rescue vintage items and give them a loving home again. I also enjoy paper crafting, stamping, collage making, decorating, scrapbooking and painting.</p><p>I'm a very passionate person, in everything that I do, which leads me to my last point. I am over-the-moon crazy about Halloween and all things spooky! I've been a lover of the dark since I was little. Horror movies are my favorite, specifically 80's slashers because they're so fantastically cheesy in all the right ways. Fall in the Midwest is gorgeous and I countdown to October all year round! Thus the origin of my brand. Pumpkin patches, apple orchards, Horror movie marathons, amazing trees and pumpkin spice everything! There is nothing better! Seriously, nothing. My passion for the dark side comes out in my perfumes. The scents, the names, the stories behind the names, the packaging. Everything. And my perfectionist ways ensure that every detail is just right. I wouldn't have it any other way!</p><p>Thank you so much for visiting my website and taking a minute to get to know me a little better. I'm honored that you've stopped by and I hope you'll be back again! Want to say hello? Drop me a line, anytime! I'd love to hear from you! Happy haunting!</p>",
