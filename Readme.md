* Complete workflow that your team designs.
* Start at any point in the workflow.
* Prototype phase, design phase, develop phase, deploy phase, they're all available.
* Easy code export makes deploying to existing infrastructure a breeze.
* Built-in tools for Less, Sass, Grunt, Gulp allow you to build code as you would on the command line.
* Symbol and pattern libraries make prototyping and visual design a snap.
* Design lo-fi and hi-fi versions of components so that the components you use for prototypes are also the final, fully-functional UI components used on your published site.
* All CSS, HTML and JavaScript based design tools means you can sutomize almost everything.
